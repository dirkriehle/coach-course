# Coaching Agile Teams (COACH)

Students learn to coach agile teams by assuming the Scrum Master role for an AMOS project team (https://uni1.de/amos) and helping the team in improving its processes, most notably by creating a learning opportunity and conducting a workshop for it.

The course schedule is at https://coach.uni1.de and the companion course is at https://amos.uni1.de
